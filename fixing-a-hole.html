        <br>A short film inspired by the art practice of Jessica Ostrowicz. A meditation on the act of repair, the passage of time, and the integrity within the imperfect. It invites the viewer to reflect on their own relationship with their home and the stories that are embedded within its walls.
        <br><br>Exhibited as a part of 'The Stone House' at The Steamship, London, 2022.
