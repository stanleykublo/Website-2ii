        <br>A podcast guest tries to tell the presenter a story, but they seem not to understand. He says it changed his life, and yet it seems impossible, beyond a certain point, to get the interviewer to grasp what he's saying.
        <br>
        <br> 
        Focuses on the limits of verbal communication and connection, and the risks involved in attempting to convince people of a truth you hold dear. Also about what would happen if one day driving home you just stopped the car and waited, for a very long time.    <br>
