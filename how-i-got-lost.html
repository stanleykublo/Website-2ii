        <br>A man looks for meaning in his life and in the world around him. Instead of finding it, he gets lost on a search that includes mushroom foraging on golf courses, musical instruments wedged in piles of rubbish, and silent snowed-in housing estates due for demolition.
        <br>
        <br>A meditation on the nature of self, and the search for meaning and identity in a world that can appear, and be, fragmented, choatic, and overwhelming.
