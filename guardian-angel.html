        <br>Vic, the gentle custodian of a beautiful but vacant church, finds her peaceful routine disrupted when a property agent arrives to photograph the building for its impending sale. As she uncovers the unsettling truth about the new owners, Vic must confront the fate of the sacred space she holds dear.<br><br> 
        Guardian Angel is a drama about loss, and the pain of facing a changing world. A slow-burn, atmospheric film that allows the audience to breathe in the story in the silent spaces. <br>
